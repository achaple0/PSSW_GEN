# Password Generator GUI Application

## **Overview**
The Password Generator GUI Application is a user-friendly tool designed to create secure and customizable passwords for various needs. Built with Python and a graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter`, this program allows users to specify password length and include different character types, ensuring a balance between security and convenience.

---

## **Features**
- **Customizable Password Composition:**
  - Include/exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
- **Adjustable Length:** Specify the exact number of characters for your password.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Copy the generated password with a single click for quick use.
- **Validation:** Ensures that all inputs are valid and alerts the user when constraints are unmet.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple, intuitive design for easy navigation.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Select Preferences:**
   - Use checkboxes to choose character types (e.g., uppercase, numbers).
   - Adjust the password length using a slider or input field.

2. **Generate Password:**
   - Click the "Generate" button to create a password based on the selected criteria.

3. **Copy to Clipboard:**
   - Use the "Copy" button to instantly copy the generated password for immediate use.

## **Technical Details**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Modules Used:**
  - `tkinter`: For creating the graphical user interface.
  - `random`: For generating random characters.
  - `string`: For accessing predefined character sets.
  - `pyperclip` (optional): For clipboard functionality.
- **Design Approach:** 
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for flexibility and scalability.
  - Modular structure for maintainability:
    - `main.py`: Entry point for the application.
    - `password_generator.py`: Handles password generation logic.
    - `gui.py`: Manages GUI components and user interactions.

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generator.git
   cd password-generator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure Python is installed. Then install additional modules if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install pyperclip
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.6 or later
- `tkinter` (pre-installed with Python on most systems)
- Optional: `pyperclip` for clipboard integration

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add strength indicators to evaluate the security of generated passwords.
- Include options to avoid similar characters (e.g., `O` and `0`).
- Provide advanced password policies (e.g., must contain at least one uppercase and one number).
